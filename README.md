# How it Works
This treats the whipper trebuchet as a system of rods and point masses to approximate its motion and dynamics.

# Shortcomings
The sling is also treated as a rod and point mass, meaning any curvature or propagation of motion across the sling is not accounted for.

# To-dos:
Simulation of the sling as it deploys is incomplete.
Simulation of the projectile as it releases and of the release point is incomplete.
